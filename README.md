# colorjs

This library started as a companion to a blog post,
[Pattern Matching Custom Data Types in Typescript](https://blog.parametricstudios.com/posts/pattern-matching-custom-data-types/),
but has grown into a fun side project to learn how to convert color formats like
RGB, HSL, etc.

The source code is organized into some color utils that handle parsing and
converting color formats, and color classes that represent the different
formats. Testing is done with Jest.

Conversion formulas were derived from the helpful info on
[rapidtables.com](https://www.rapidtables.com).
